What is DML Triggers?
-The triggers are nothing but logics like stored procedure which executes automatically and the triggers which executs 
in response to DML triggers is called as DML Triggers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are the types of DML Triggers?
1.After Trigger-(It is also called as For Trigger)It executes after the execution of insert ,update or delete operation 
or event.Firstly Insert/Update/Delete operations takes place and after that trigger get fired.
2.Instead of Trigger- It get fired instead of Insert/Update/Delete operations.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages of Trigger:
1.It is like stored procedure, we can use it many time that means reuse of that query is possible.
2.Helps to apply some validations to data(like age should not be more than 25)
3.Helps in catching error
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When we create trigger for Insert/Update/Delete operations and after execution of this operations trigger get fired and that 
time sql server creates table with name insered and this table is only accessible withen the trigger context.And in this table
the data is maintained which is inserted/deleted/updated from the main table.
